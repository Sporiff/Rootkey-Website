About Me
========

My name is Ciarán. I'm a writer, musician, and aspiring computer guy.

I have a background in film and Japanese mythology, both of which I studied in
university. My postgraduate thesis was on 物の哀れ in Japanese animation and
the use of 妖怪 as vessels for this poetic concept.

Since then, I've mostly been working with computers. I'm a big fan and user of
GNU/Linux (though I rarely get to work with it in paying jobs, much to my
chagrin). This blog is mostly dedicated to my (mis)adventures with computers
and other bits of tech, as well as anything else I might like to dump out of my
brain.
