Throwing my Hat in the Ring
---------------------------

Switching to reStructuredText
-----------------------------

I really like Markdown. I've sung its praises before and I stand by my decision
to invest in using it at work, but since I started using reStructuredText on the
`Funkwhale Docs <https://docs.funkwhale.audio>`_, I have started to realise how
much more I enjoy it as a markup language. As such, I'm switching over to producing
these posts in rst. What difference does this make to readers? None. What difference
does it make to me? It just makes writing a bit more comfortable. That's it. Let's
move on.
