About Me
========

My name is Ciarán. I'm a writer, musician, and aspiring computer guy.

I have a background in film and Japanese mythology, both of which I studied in
university. My postgraduate thesis was on *mono no aware* in Japanese animation and
the use of *yōkai* as vessels for this poetic concept.

Since then, I've mostly been working with computers. I'm a big fan and user of
GNU/Linux (though I rarely get to work with it in paying jobs, much to my
chagrin). This blog is mostly dedicated to my (mis)adventures with computers
and other bits of tech, as well as anything else I might like to dump out of my
brain.

This site is dark by default, but you can make it light if you prefer by
hitting the lightbulb. Why would you, though?
