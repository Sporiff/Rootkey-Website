<h2>Making a difference<a class="headerlink" href="#making-a-difference" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It feels good to actually have a positive impact on something.
One of my biggest gripes about working in support is that you
are - as a support agent - inevitably the face of disappoinment
and/or failure at some point. The job is time and attention demanding,
and sometimes you simply have to tell someone that things they
want are not possible.</p>
<p>This is devastating for morale. It’s something I’ve seen in all
my support jobs: the tickets keep coming and all you can do is
try to answer them all in SLA. It’s a hosepipe of negativity
which can really get you down after a period of time. Occassionally,
you’ll get to the bottom of a particularly nasty problem and really
make somebody’s day better. For the most part, though, it’s a
thankless job with a lot of disappointment and no real goals to
work towards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="turn-it-around">
<h2>Turn it Around<a class="headerlink" href="#turn-it-around" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my previous roles I have tried to find pragmatic and practical
ways to lessen the negativity of the support role by using my
unique frontline position to directly address the gripes and
grievances of customers and coworkers alike. During my time as
a frontline hardware repair worker/desktop support agent I spent
all my spare time automating small tasks to try and take some of
the pain away from the mundane, everyday jobs. I took this approach
with me when I was promoted to systems technician, using my newfound
access to simplify and automate many of the things which had caused
me misery on the frontline so that it <em>never</em> had to be that bad again.</p>
<p>My current role is slightly different. For the first time in my
professional career I am working in a company that <em>makes</em> something,
which means that every decision and project has to be worth something
to the product as a whole. No more frittering away idle hours on support
desk trying to fix bits and pieces. The changes have to have a tangible
impact.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I landed this job was because of my background in
English, as well as my background as a technical writer and creator
of documentation in my previous roles. As such, I was asked to look
at the company’s help center, which is (still) in need of some updates.
As each day passed I started to pick up on something from the tickets:</p>
<p><em>Nobody</em> read our documentation.</p>
<p>We have a lot of documents, mind you. I can’t expect every client to
read every one. But the fact that the same issues came up again and
again said to me that something fundamentally needed to change. The
documents were obviously not clear or were frustrating to navigate.
Similarly, no centralised process existed to write documentation nor
a central place to put it.</p>
<p>Since I am a big fan of markup languages like Markdown and reStructuredText,
I decided to make use of Markdown when writing documents for my own
ease, from which I would then copy the pure HTML to put into our document
store to be formatted directly by CSS so that when the time came for
a redesign, everything could be changed in one fell swoop. I started
storing all of these markdown files with their corresponding HTML in
a folder structure that reflected the current layout of the help centre.
And that’s when I realised how we could fix it.</p>
<div class="section" id="you-git">
<h3>You Git<a class="headerlink" href="#you-git" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I use Git for a lot of things. I write small projects, I contribute
to some open-source projects, and I host this website on Github. It
is an elegant way to control large numbers of changing parts in a
controlled and centralised way. Given that much of what I write goes
through Git, I started to put together a proposal for making use of
our repository to host documentation. This way - I reasoned - we would
have a portable document set which could easily be recovered elsewhere,
a set which had perfect revision history and the potential to put in
requirements for submission, and a way to work both on and offline
with no issues.</p>
<p>The biggest bugbear we have at the moment is screenshots. Because the
software evolves so rapidly (and will only get faster) keeping screenshots
up-to-date is arduous. We have to open each document on Zendesk and
manually replace the image. Rinse and repeat. To remedy this, I decided
we should use Amazon S3 (which hosts a lot of our stuff already) and
keep static links to files which could be swapped out whenever a new
version was ready.</p>
<p>Having been given the go-ahead by the CTO, I am currently in the
process of porting and rewriting our entire document store. It will
take a long time, but I’m hoping that it will have the following
effects:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Customers will be more likely to use our nice-looking and accurate documents</p></li>
<li><p>Writing documents will naturally become part of our workflow regardless of what part of the company we work in</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s hoping!</p>
